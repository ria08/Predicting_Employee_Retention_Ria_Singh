Business Objective
A mid-sized technology company wants to improve its understanding of employee retention to foster a loyal and committed workforce. While the organization has traditionally focused on addressing turnover, it recognises the value of proactively identifying employees likely to stay and understanding the factors contributing to their loyalty.

In this assignment you’ll be building a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of employee retention based on the data such as demographic details, job satisfaction scores, performance metrics, and tenure. The aim is to provide the HR department with actionable insights to strengthen retention strategies, create a supportive work environment, and increase the overall stability and satisfaction of the workforce.

Key Findings:

The accuracy of the model on training data is 74.04% and on validation data is 73.74% which indicates that model generalises well to unseen data.

The recall on validation data is 71.66% and 72.26% for training data which means model is predicting most of the actual positive cases consistently.

Senior employees are most likely to stay so the company shall offer more leadership and growth opportunities.

Good work-life balance is a major factor in employee retention so the company should invest in flexible hours and wellness benefits.

Employees who have been promoted and who have dependents stay longer. Company should offer clear promotion pathways and family friendly policies.

High performers tend to stay longer. Company can incentivize high performance and offer perks and recognitions.

Married employees are more loyal. Company can offer spousal insurance and benefits to reward them.
